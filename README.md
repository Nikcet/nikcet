### 🛠️ Recent Projects

- **get_gifts_frontend & get_gifts_backend**  
  [wishesbook](https://wishesbook.ru/) is a wishlist service that makes gift planning effortless.  
  To add a desired gift to your list, simply paste the product link from any marketplace—the product information will be parsed automatically from the marketplace.  
  For data parsing, I utilized SeleniumBase to extract product details reliably and efficiently.

> *Note: I’ve also built enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation APIs (RAG-API), but they’re under NDA.*
